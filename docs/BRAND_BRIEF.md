# Microsoft Agentic AI Weekly — Brand Brief

## 1) Purpose
A weekly briefing for people building and running Microsoft agentic AI in production.

**Coverage promise:** practical, cross-stack intelligence spanning:
- Copilot Studio + Power Platform
- Azure AI Foundry + model/agent tooling
- Microsoft 365 + Graph + Teams surfaces
- Governance, security, ALM, operations, and adoption

## 2) Who It’s For
Three audience tiers, each issue should serve all three:

- **Builder** (makers/devs): what to build next, how to ship safely, what changed technically.
- **Platform Owner** (admins/architects/CoE): governance controls, lifecycle, reliability, risk, cost, operations.
- **Leader** (heads of product/IT/digital): strategic implications, business impact, where to invest/avoid.

## 3) Editorial Promise
Every issue must be **decision-useful**, not a link dump.

For each key item, include:
- **Why it matters** (1 line)
- **Who should care** (Builder / Platform Owner / Leader)
- **Action signal** (Watch / Pilot / Adopt)
- **Confidence** (Official / Reputable community / Early signal)

Quality bar:
- high signal, low fluff
- clear attribution + source links
- explicit uncertainty labeling
- no rumor amplification without context

## 4) Voice & Tone Rules
- Direct, calm, technically literate
- Slightly opinionated where useful; never hypey
- Explain implications, not marketing claims
- Prefer concrete language over buzzwords
- Keep copy tight; default to scannable bullets

## 5) Content Boundaries
Include:
- product changes that affect design, delivery, governance, or operations
- patterns, pitfalls, and repeatable practices
- ecosystem shifts with near-term enterprise impact

Exclude by default:
- generic AI news with no Microsoft agentic relevance
- purely promotional content with no implementation detail
- unverified claims without credible sources

## 6) Approval-First Policy (Non-Negotiable)
No autonomous publish/send.

**Human approval required before:**
1. publishing any website issue
2. sending any email/newsletter
3. adding/removing tracked sources

Workflow intent:
- system prepares queue + draft issue + draft email
- editor reviews and approves
- publish/send happens only after explicit approval

## 7) Brand Positioning (One-Liner)
**Microsoft Agentic AI Weekly helps builders, platform owners, and leaders make better weekly decisions across the full Microsoft agentic stack.**

## 8) Success Criteria for Redesign
- A first-time visitor can identify audience fit in <10 seconds
- Issue pages make “what changed / why it matters / what to do next” obvious
- Navigation reflects cross-stack coverage (Build, Run, Govern, Lead)
- Approval-first trust model is visible in process docs and workflow
